  This program uses a Star Wars API, http://swapi.co/api/, to allow the user to look at star wars data. It has the following categories that people can look at to get star wars information: 

  people
  planets
  films
  species
  vehicles
  starships

  This project is done for the most part. I could still have a section on the vehicles but I felt that I was repeating myself way to much. I did learn what I needed to on this project as well. I am also still debatting if I want to open up an issue for this code to shrink it down.
